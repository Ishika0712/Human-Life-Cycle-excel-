The dashboard reveals fluctuations in mental well-being across different life stages, with higher stress indicators observed during adolescence and early adulthood, often linked to academic pressure and career uncertainty.

Daily Routine Patterns: 

Consistent sleep cycles, physical activity, and reduced screen time are correlated with improved mental health scores. Irregular routines show a noticeable dip in emotional and cognitive performance.

**âœ… Conclusion**

Mental health is dynamic and closely influenced by age, lifestyle habits, and life transitions. The analysis highlights the importance of monitoring mental well-being regularlyâ€”especially during high-stress phases such as adolescence and midlife.

Individuals struggling with irregular sleep patterns, anxiety, or daily fatigue may benefit from mindfulness practices such as meditation, which can help regulate emotions, improve focus, and enhance sleep quality.

Regular physical activityâ€”even light exercise like walking or yogaâ€”has a proven positive impact on mental health by reducing stress hormones and boosting mood-enhancing chemicals like endorphins.

A well-structured daily routine that balances sleep, nutrition, physical movement, work, and recreation can significantly improve emotional resilience andÂ mentalÂ clarity.
